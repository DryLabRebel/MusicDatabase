Database design and project Ideas
=================================

I need a project. If I want to learn SQL properly, and do hard things, I need a project.

Come up with a database idea
----------------------------

### Music ###

- I could start storing and organising my music collection info
  - primary key, song title, artist, album, record company, genre, sub-genre, length, rating, 
  - I could tediously go through and update the information on every song with proper album info, and gather artwork and other stuff
    - this would be a great way to reinforce the basic SQL commands for updating table info
    - I could use it to organise and streamline the info for each song, to create consistent genres and sub genres
  - I could use this to actually organise my music collection, update the info properly
  - Could I store the *actual* music
- I would need to think about
  - The best kind of primary key to use
  - Where to find the song info (is the iTunes data structured enough to make it easy to import?)

### Real Estate ###

- I could create a real estate watch databse
  - I could catalogue a random selection of properties for sale across Queensland with information about each property, I could then run full analyses to answer questions like:
    - What suburbs are generally the cheapest?
    - Which have the best re-sale value?
    - Which ones appear to be on the rise in terms of property value?
    - What is the density of for sale homes to the estimated population size/growth, no of houses, etc.

Any other bright ideas?

### Family tree ###

  - heirarchical database?

### Simulated twin data ###

  - I could simulate the data in R, save it into a SQL database
  - I could have a bunch of different simulated phenotypes - 'normal', 'skewed', 'highly correlated', 'low correlation', 'shared environment effects'
  - I could have 3-4 sibs for each family, some triplets

Learn how to build a good database
----------------------------------

- I need to think about the information that will be able to be stored for my music, how and where to get it
- Learn the basics of database design, and get started quickly
- Learn how to use python to scrape the song info from my existing music collections

figure out where to get your data

figure out how to get your data

  - python
  - R
  - Java

Remember the goal is data science
  - learn some SQL, but also learn other stuff
    - Data collection
    - Big data, HPC computing
    - Use these projects to think of and run some analyses
