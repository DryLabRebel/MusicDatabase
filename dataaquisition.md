Data Aquisition
===============

This is the information I need:

    artist, album, release_year, track_no, title, composer, length, rating, filename, date_added, genre, subgenre

These are my primary and secondary keys:

    artistID	albumID trackID genre	subgenre

How do I find and access the metadata for my Music library?

Bash:

    mdls path/to/filename

Python:

    ???

Could I pipe the bash command into a python scipt which parses the information and feeds it into an SQL script, which automatically updates a database?

What do I want to do now?

Start building my tables?

How? If I want to reinforce some of the most basic SQL commands, I could go through one at a time and just start adding song info by hand... seriously?

Otherwise I could write a simple (simple?) python or bash (or perl, or awk) script which mines my Music directory for all the information I need, and automatically fills tables according to my specifications?

Oh man, I don't even know where to start.

If I wanted to learn python, this is my first real opportunity

What do I want to do?

Suppose I wanted to mine the information using a python script.

I can then either
- save all the information as .txt dataframes - then use SQL to add these tables to my music database?
- feed this into a SQL script which automatically adds/updates the information to the relevant tables

How would I even start?

- Learn some python?
- Just get started?

*I need to learn some SQL*
*I need to learn some python*

Here's a great stack question to get you started:

        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8948/accessing-mp3-metadata-with-python

OK, so there's `eyeD3` and `mutagen`. Apparently both python libraries (packages?), both parse metadata.

What am I thinking about?

Here's what I need:

    artist, album, release_year, track_no, title, composer, length, rating, filename, date_added, genre, subgenre

Could get away with:

    artist, album, release_year, track_no, title, length, filename, date_added, genre

- mdls doesn't give me all the info I'm looking for. It's more system info.
