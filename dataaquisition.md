Data Aquisition
===============

This is the information I need:

    artist, album, release_year, track_no, title, composer, length, rating, filename, date_added, genre, subgenre

These are my primary and secondary keys:

    artistID	albumID trackID genre	subgenre

How do I find and access the metadata for my Music library?

    mdls path/to/filename

What do I want to do now?

Start building my tables?

How? If I want to reinforce some of the most basic SQL commands, I could go through one at a time and just start adding song info by hand... seriously?

Otherwise I could write a simple (simple?) python or bash (or perl, or awk) script which mines my Music directory for all the information I need, and automatically fills tables according to my specifications?
