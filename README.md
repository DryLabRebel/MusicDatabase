A repo for my Music Database project
====================================

Keeping music organised on a computer is one of those love/hate things,

It's fun, and always good to enjoy your music, but can be notoriously difficult when you have
multiple formats, styles and duplicate songs to deal with.

This repo is primarly a showcase for my portfolio, but hopefully, if i do it well,
it will make for a halfway decent attempt to catalogue and finally organise my music collection once and for all.
